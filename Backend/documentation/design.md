# MMPs Backend - Design Document

## 1. Introduction

The MMPs backend serves as the core component responsible for handling authentication, quiz management, and user data processing. This document outlines the design decisions and architecture of the backend system.

## 2. Architecture

The backend architecture follows a modular and scalable design, leveraging the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for separation of concerns. The key components of the backend architecture include:

### 2.1. Controllers

Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, process data, and interact with the appropriate services to execute business logic. Separate controllers are implemented for different functionalities, such as authentication, quiz management, and user management.

### 2.2. Services

Services encapsulate the business logic of the application and perform operations such as user authentication, quiz creation, and data manipulation. Each service is responsible for a specific domain within the application and interacts with the database and external APIs as needed.

### 2.3. Models

Models represent the data structures used within the application and define the schema for the database tables. Each model corresponds to a database table and includes methods for querying and manipulating data.

### 2.4. Middleware

Middleware functions are used to intercept incoming requests and perform common tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling. Middleware functions are applied globally or selectively to specific routes as needed.

### 2.5. Routes

Routes define the endpoints exposed by the backend API and map incoming HTTP requests to the corresponding controller methods. Routes are organized based on functionality, such as authentication routes, quiz routes, and user routes.

## 3. Database Schema

The backend utilizes a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user data, quiz information, and authentication tokens. The database schema includes the following tables:

1. **Users**: Stores user information including username, email, password hash, and biometric data.
2. **Quizzes**: Stores information about quizzes including title, description, questions, and answers.
3. **Sessions**: Stores authentication tokens and session information for user sessions.

The database schema is designed to enforce data integrity, optimize query performance, and ensure scalability.

## 4. Security Measures

The backend implements various security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the system. Key security measures include:

- **Data Encryption**: User passwords and sensitive data are stored using strong encryption algorithms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Authentication Tokens**: User sessions are managed using authentication tokens generated upon successful login, which are validated for each subsequent request.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict access to sensitive functionalities and resources based on user roles.

## 5. Error Handling

The backend includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors gracefully. Error responses are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages to assist users and developers in troubleshooting.

## 6. Logging

The backend logs system events, errors, and user activities to facilitate monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing. Logs are stored centrally and can be analyzed to identify performance issues and security threats.

## 7. Testing Strategy

The backend is thoroughly tested using unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability, correctness, and performance of the system. Test coverage is regularly monitored and maintained to minimize the risk of regressions.

## 8. Deployment

The backend is deployed to a scalable and reliable infrastructure, utilizing cloud services such as AWS or Azure. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented to automate the deployment process and ensure the availability of the latest features and fixes.

## 9. Future Enhancements

Future enhancements to the backend may include:

- Integration with additional biometric modalities for enhanced authentication.
- Implementation of advanced analytics and reporting features for quizzes and user activities.
- Optimization of database queries and performance tuning for scalability.
